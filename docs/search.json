While this might feel drastic, it makes sense. Aerial tramways, vehicles suspended from a system of cables that are propelled through a suspension system, are not commonly used, which attributes to their low mileage. On the other hand, buses are used extensively, with there being numerous routes that run daily, attributing to their high mileage.\nFollowing this contrast, the agency with the least total VRM was Barnegat Bay Decoy & Baymen’s Museum, with 2,312 miles.\n\nUSAGE |&gt;\n  group_by(Agency) |&gt;   # Look through the lens of transportation agency   \n  summarize(total_vrm = sum(vehicle_revenue_miles, na.rm = T)) |&gt;   # Obtain the total VRM per agency\n  arrange(total_vrm) |&gt;   # Ascending order\n  slice(1)   # Obtain the top data point\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                               total_vrm\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Barnegat Bay Decoy & Baymen's Museum      2312\n\n\nCompared to the MTA, there is a difference of 10,799,997,688 miles. This large difference can be attributed to the vast difference in sizes between the two. The MTA is the largest transportation system in North America. On the other hand, Barnegat is only a 40 acre cultural center meant to preserve the maritime history of the Jersey Shore. The VRM accumulated correlate to the size and population attributed to each agency.\nBecause the MTA in NYC has been established as having the largest VRM, examining which location has the second highest average vehicle revenue miles, after the New York / New Jersey area, would be interesting.\n\nUSAGE |&gt; \n  group_by(metro_area) |&gt;   # Look through the lens of location\n  summarize(average_vrm = mean(vehicle_revenue_miles, na.rm = T)) |&gt; # Obtain the average VRM per location\n  arrange(desc(average_vrm)) |&gt;   # Descending order\n  slice(2)   # Obtain the second data point\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  metro_area         average_vrm\n  &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Denver--Aurora, CO    1565688.\n\n\nThis turns out to be Denver, Colorado, with 1,565,688 average VRM. This is a 244,360 mile difference to NYC, with 1,810,058 miles."
