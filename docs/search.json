While this might feel drastic, it makes sense. Aerial tramways, vehicles suspended from a system of cables that are propelled through a suspension system, are not commonly used, which attributes to their low mileage. On the other hand, buses are used extensively, with there being numerous routes that run daily, attributing to their high mileage.\nFollowing this contrast, the agency with the least total vehicle revenue miles was Barnegat Bay Decoy & Baymen’s Museum, with 2,312 miles.\nUSAGE |&gt; \n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_vrm = sum(vehicle_revenue_miles, na.rm = T)) |&gt;\n  arrange(total_vrm)\nCompared to the MTA, there is a difference of 10,799,997,688 miles. This large difference can be attributed to the vast difference in sizes between the two. The MTA is the largest transportation system in North America. On the other hand, Barnegat is only a 40 acre cultural center meant to preserve the maritime history of the Jersey Shore. The vehicle revenue miles accumulated correlate to the size and population attributed to each agency.\nBecause we’ve established the MTA in NYC as having the largest total vehicle revenue miles, we can examine which location has the second highest average vehicle revenue miles, after the New York / New Jersey area. This turns out to be Denver, Colorado, with 1,565,688 average vehicle revenue miles.\nUSAGE |&gt; \n  group_by(metro_area) |&gt;\n  summarize(average_vrm = mean(vehicle_revenue_miles, na.rm = T)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(average_vrm))\nThis is a 244,360 mile difference to NYC, with 1,810,058 miles."
