<p>To the average person, “UZA Name” doesn’t provide proper context or meaning; thus, it needs to be changed to something people will understand, like “Metro Area.” The same can be said about “UPT” and “VRM”; these also need to be changed, as follows:</p>

<p>Now that some column headers have been renamed, focus can be made on the “Mode” column. All of these modes of transport are acronyms that would need to be looked up to be understood. For user ease, they’ll be changed as follows:</p>

<p>Here, in May 2024, <strong>180,458,819</strong> trips were taken.</p>
<p>While this number is indeed high, it would be interesting to analyze the impact the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/about/index.html">COVID-19 pandemic</a> had on NYC Subway ridership. To do so, the <strong>fall of NYC subway ridership between April 2019 and April 2020</strong> needs to be determined:</p>

<p>In contrast to buses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_tramway"><strong>aerial tramways</strong></a> were the <strong>transit mode with the least total VRM</strong>, with <strong>292,850</strong> miles.</p>
<p>This is a difference of 49,444,201,238 miles. While this might feel drastic, it makes sense. Aerial tramways, vehicles suspended from a system of cables that are propelled through a suspension system, are not commonly used, which attributes to their low mileage. On the other hand, buses are used extensively, with there being numerous routes that run daily, attributing to their high mileage.</p>
<p>Following this contrast, the <strong>agency with the least total VRM</strong> was <a href="https://tuckertonseaport.org/about/"><strong>Barnegat Bay Decoy &amp; Baymen’s Museum</strong></a>, with <strong>2,312</strong> miles.</p>

<p>Compared to the MTA, there is a difference of 10,799,997,688 miles. This large difference can be attributed to the vast difference in sizes between the two. The MTA is the largest transportation system in North America. On the other hand, Barnegat is only a 40 acre cultural center meant to preserve the maritime history of the Jersey Shore. The VRM accumulated correlate to the size and population attributed to each agency.</p>
<p>Because the MTA in NYC has been established as having the largest VRM, examining <strong>which location has the second highest average vehicle revenue miles</strong>, after the New York / New Jersey area, would be interesting.</p>

<p>Overall, the most efficient transit system in the country is the <strong>MTA New York City Transit</strong>. It is the largest North American transit system, and has proven that it is as efficient as its size. It has the <strong>most total and average vehicle revenue miles</strong>. Additionally, in 2022, it was the transit system with the <strong>most unlinked passenger trips</strong>.</p>
